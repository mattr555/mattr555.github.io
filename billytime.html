		OVERALL TRENDS: Most of the important things were lugubrious things, like marrying someone he didn’t love, being captured in war, or observing the death of 135,000 people. After the plane crash, he is unable to separate these traumatic incidents from his life, and turns to the writings of Kilgore Trout to explain this phenomenon. Billy’s story reveals a striking semblance to The Big Board, indicating that the story of the Tralfamadorians is likely a coping mechanism. He tries to focus on the good, as the Tralfamadorians recommend, but is unable to, as he keeps reliving and revisiting his traumatic, haunting past.
