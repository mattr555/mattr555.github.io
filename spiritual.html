	<h3>The Hopeless People</h3>
	A spiritual by Matthew Ramina and Emma Clark<br>
	To the tune of "Eleanor Rigby" by the Beatles<br>
	<br>
	Ah, look at all the hopeless people<br>
	Ah, look at all the hopeless people <br>
	<br>
	All over the South<br>
	My people are crying in anguish and full of despair<br>
	They live in a nightmare<br>
	Waiting for freedom<br>
	We didn’t wait we just left for a safer place<br>
	The dawn was dim as we raced<br>
	<br>
	All those we’ve left behind<br>
	What will they all do<br>
	All those we’ve left behind<br>
	Where do they all belong?<br>
	<br>
	The wind was howling<br>
	The sun rising at our backs as we raced away<br>
	Nowhere to hide<br>
	Finding our courage<br>
	Fleeing through miles of amber fields and corn rows<br>
	No one would know<br>
	<br>
	All those we’ve left behind<br>
	What will they all do<br>
	All those we’ve left behind<br>
	Where do they all belong?<br>
	Ah, look at all the hopeless people <br>
	Ah, look at all the hopeless people<br>
	<br>
	Our work was hard<br>
	Our journey far and our faith undying<br>
	We always kept trying<br>
	We’ve reached our freedom <br>
	Galloped away from the past to a bright new life<br>
	Avoided the strife <br>
	<br>
	All those we’ve left behind<br>
	What will they all do<br>
	All those we’ve left behind<br>
	Where do they all belong?<br>
