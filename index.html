	<h1>Hi!</h1>
	I'm Matt Ramina. <br>
	I <a href="https://twitter.com/mattr555">tweet</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mattr555">write software</a>, and attend High Technology High School. But not in that order. <br>
	If you can't tell from this bare web page, I'm not really a web designer...but I have contributed to other types of projects, including:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.apertium.org/">Apertium</a>, through the awesome <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/?csw=1">Google Code-In</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://ddg.gg/">DuckDuckGo</a>, through <a href="http://duckduckhack.com/">DuckDuckHack</a></li>
	</ul>
	I have my own projects, of course. Most everything I do is on GitHub, but if it's just a one-file thing I'll probably tweet about it and gist it. My largest/most notable project is the one where I made a <a href="https://github.com/mattr555/AtYourService-school">web app to track NHS hours.</a><br>
	I also like to play around with physical things using Arduino or VEX, where I've competed with awesome teammates. Finally, I write a lot of python and compete in venues such as the American Computer Science League and Google Code Jam. <br>
